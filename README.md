Final Project Proposal

The proposed project aims to investigate the relationship between a company's profit and its stock price, leveraging Python programming and data analysis techniques. Understanding this relationship is crucial for investors, financial analysts, and companies themselves, as it provides insights into market dynamics, investment decisions, and business performance evaluation. As students majoring in mathematical economics and cognitive science and having interests in the financial world, this project aligns closely with our academic background and interests. It allows us to apply quantitative analysis and programming skills to real-world financial data, bridging theory with practical applications. Moreover, gaining insights into the factors influencing stock prices and profitability enhances our understanding of financial markets, aiding in future career pursuits in finance, investment analysis, or data-driven decision-making roles. We are particularly interested in this project because it combines our passion for finance with our skills in data analysis and programming. Analyzing the relationship between company profit and stock price provides a real-world application of financial concepts and allows us to deepen our understanding of stock market dynamics.
For the project, financial datasets containing company financial statements, for instance, the income statements and balance sheets, and historical stock price data are essential. One potential source for such data is the Yahoo Finance API, which provides historical stock price data for publicly traded companies. Alternatively, datasets can be obtained from financial data providers like Quandl or directly from company financial reports available on their websites or through regulatory filings. For the computing powers, the CPU is going to fulfill our task requirements. In addition to that, google colab and jupyter notebooks are important resources for us to use. 
Below are some datasets that we are going to use: 
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/history
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history
The first dataset includes the historical stock price for Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), and the second dataset includes the historical stock price for Apple Inc. (AAPL), both have currency in USD. Each dataset enables us to choose the time period that we are interested in, specific to an exact date. Besides, except for the historical stock price, the data of stock splits, capital gains, and dividends are also available. Additionally, the columns in the datasets include the highest and lowest stock price in a day, which is also helpful when analyzing the changing trend in a day for a company.
Previous research has explored the relationship between company financial performance and stock prices using various econometric models, including regression analysis, time series analysis, event studies and machine learning models.  For machine learning models, methods like decision tree, logistic regression, SVM and neural networks (CNNs, RNNs) are widely used. The models mostly used to predict stock prices are LSTM  models.  Studies have found that positive earnings surprises or improvements in profit margins tend to lead to increases in stock prices, while negative earnings surprises or declining profitability can result in stock price declines.
Through this project, we anticipate gaining a comprehensive understanding of data analysis techniques applied to financial data, further honing our skills in machine learning and statistical modeling. Specifically, we aim to enhance our proficiency in manipulating and visualizing financial datasets using Python libraries, conducting rigorous statistical analysis to discover meaningful relationships between company profitability and stock prices, and effectively communicating our findings through presentations. Moreover, we also look forward to developing a deeper insight into the intricacies of financial markets and investment decision-making processes, leveraging data-driven approaches to derive actionable insights and inform strategic investment decisions. Overall, this project provides us an invaluable opportunity to integrate theoretical knowledge with practical applications, fostering our comprehensive understanding of quantitative finance and data-driven decision-making principles.
Our group members include: Chuhan Ding, Xiaoxu Yang, Yanjun Jin.
Below is our tentative timeline for this project:
Week 5: Background research, data collection and data preprocessing.
Week 6: Data cleaning, feature selection, standardization & PCA.
Week 7: Training machine learning models.
Week 8: In-depth study and troubleshooting.
Week 9: Complete final report.
Week 10: Final practice for the presentation.
For this collaborative project, all our group members will work together synergistically, pooling our diverse skill sets and expertise in finance, data analysis, and programming. We will collectively contribute to all aspects of the project, from data collection and preprocessing to exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization. Specifically, Yanjun will take part in data preprocessing, training models, and analyzing with a focus on programming and troubleshooting. Chuhan and Xiaoxun will take data collection and financial advising roles, and will also train models, analyze results and play important roles in strategy development and documentation. Additionally, we will jointly participate in project documentation, presentation development, and report writing. Through these collective efforts, we aspire to create a high-quality project that reflects our combined dedication, expertise, and collaborative spirit.

大纲
Topic
a. 公司profit对于其股票价格的影响
The project aims to explore the relationship between a company's profitability and its stock price. Specifically, it seeks to investigate how fluctuations in a company's profit metrics, such as net income, earnings per share (EPS), and profit margins, impact its stock price. Understanding this relationship can provide valuable insights for investors, analysts, and financial professionals in making informed investment decisions.
b. Stock exchange prediction


We are particularly interested in this project because it combines my passion for finance with my skills in data analysis and programming. Analyzing the relationship between company profit and stock price provides a real-world application of financial concepts and allows me to deepen my understanding of stock market dynamics.
